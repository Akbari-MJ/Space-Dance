CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindSDL2_ttf.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "SDL2_ttf",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "SDL2_ttf" with any
  of the following names:

    SDL2_ttfConfig.cmake
    sdl2_ttf-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "SDL2_ttf" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "SDL2_ttf_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "SDL2_ttf" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
